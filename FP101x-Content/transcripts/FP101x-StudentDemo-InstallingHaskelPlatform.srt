Hello everyone! My name is Georgi and I'm
one of the TAs for this course and in this

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:12,600
video I want to show you how to install GHC
and in particular the Haskell Platform. To

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:20,300
install, first we have to find the Haskell
Platform, so let us Google that. It's immediately

4
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:27,350
the first hit. On this website we are offered
the choice of the system that we want to install

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:35,400
on. I'm using a Mac right now, so I will click
on Mac. The download link is up here - Haskell

6
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:42,400
Platform 2014. I'm downloading it now. In
fact, I have already downloaded this file,

7
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:49,989
so let's just go ahead and click on it. The
installer starts by double clicking on it

8
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:56,579
and then we are presented with the usual menu.
We click on continue. It takes more than 1GB

9
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:03,579
of space, which we are more than happy to
use for Haskell. Then we click install.

10
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:13,620
We input our password to authorize Haskell to
install and wait for it to finish.

11
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:26,200
There it is! It also redirects us to the documentation
page for the Haskell Platform where you can

12
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,400
read up on all the ins and outs and the things
you can do with it. So let's start with some

13
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:43,799
simple examples. I have 2 prompts open here.
In one I will open up my editor - which is,

14
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:53,299
of course, vi. I have a file called test.hs
- recall that .hs is the extension for Haskell

15
00:01:53,299 --> 00:02:01,639
files. In this file I have defined 2 functions,
as mentioned in the lecture, double and quadruple.

16
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:13,020
Now I would like to see them in action, so
I type "ghci test.hs". We see a lot of text being

17
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:19,480
printed out, but the most important thing
is right here - Ok, modules loaded: Main.

18
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:27,500
Now we can start testing the functions by
simply typing in their name: double 10, which

19
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:38,180
makes it 20. Also notice that we can use tab
completion. So for quadruple 30 we get 120.

20
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,800
Let's go back to the editor that we have on
the left and simply add 2 new functions as

21
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:53,810
we have also seen in the lecture, in this
case: factorial and average. 

22
00:02:53,980 --> 00:03:01,760
GHCi is still running in our case and all we need to do
to load the new functions is type :reload.

23
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:10,129
GHCi tells us that everything went ok, so
now we can go ahead and test these functions.

24
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,700
Let's say factorial of 10. 

25
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:26,640
Something's not going right! My bad! 
I haven't saved the file

26
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:34,160
yet, so I do need to save it before it can
be reloaded. I reload once again. Modules

27
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:43,020
are loaded. Now I try factorial of 10 and
I get the right answer. Let's try average

28
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:50,030
of a list of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. I get the number 3. 

29
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,620
This is a very simple introduction to how

30
00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:00,620
to install the Haskell Platform, how to use
it, how to load files and how to start editing.

31
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,060
Thank you!
