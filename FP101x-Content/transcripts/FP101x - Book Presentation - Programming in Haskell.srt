00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:04,730
The content of this MOOC is based on the
fantastic book

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,710
by Graham Hutton: Programming in Haskell.


3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,870
I strongly recommend that,

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,259
as you follow the lectures,
you

5
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:19,630
read the chapters in the book for extra
background information

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:24,439
and deeper knowledge. Cambridge
University Press has been so kind

7
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:28,220
to offer you a 25% discount on
the book,

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,040
both on the printed version and on the
electronic version.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,559
Of course, you don't have to type
in this URL here;

10
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,450
the URL will be available on the
course website,

11
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,809
Please consider to get the book
because I think it will

12
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:48,219
very much enhance the learning
experience of this MOOC.

13
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:51,350
Have a lot of fun and happy hacking!
