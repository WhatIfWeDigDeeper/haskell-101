1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:05,140
Welcome back! 
I hope you have all installed GHC

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,599
and played a little bit by typing in
expressions.

3
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:13,330
What we're going to do now is move beyond
simple expressions

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:18,350
and see how we can load full Haskell
programs

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:23,310
into GHC. 
In Haskell, programs are not called

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,260
programs. Typically Haskell people refer
to their code

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,689
as scripts because 

8
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,190
Haskell programs are maybe shorter
than normal code.

9
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,730
I just call them Haskell programs,

10
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,550
but the haskell parlance

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,899
is scripts.

12
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:50,610
New functions, if you want to
define a complete Haskell program,

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,870
you define them in a

14
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,170
text file that contains a list of function
definitions

15
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,840
and this text file

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,040
has a suffix .hs that indicates
that it's a

17
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,170
Haskell file. 
Just like an HTML file has an

18
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,340
.html suffix, or CSS files have .css

19
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,890
suffix, or Java file

20
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,350
has a .java suffix,

21
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,000
a Haskell file is called whatever

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,049
.hs. So this is not mandatory,

23
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:32,320
but it's useful that you can see when you

24
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,689
list the files in a directory that you
can see that this

25
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:40,210
is a Haskell script. 
Now when you

26
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:44,430
are using GHC,

27
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,530
what you do is you edit your

28
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,049
script in one window, using whatever
editor of choice,

29
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,259
and then whenever you make a change, you
load your

30
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,460
script into GHC and
start

31
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,590
executing expressions. 
So that's the kind of workflow

32
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,369
that we will be using for most of the
course. For simple things

33
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:12,080
that's what you. Of course, when you're
building commercial Haskell applications

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,420
this is not what you do.

35
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,450
You will compile them into standalone
executables,

36
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,550
but for the purposes of this course, this
is the workflow: we have

37
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,950
the editor window open, we have the GHCi
interpreter open

38
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,150
and then we will load the scripts.
In this case,

39
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,880
we will create a

40
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,140
text file test.hs and in there

41
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,840
we put two function definitions. 
The first one:

42
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,380
double of x equals x + x
- does what it promises -

43
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,890
and then we can quadruple by
calling double of double of x.

44
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:55,459
So we save that file and then
we start

45
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:59,690
GHCi and invoking it with

46
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:04,400
test.hs and now both the Haskell
standard library

47
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,220
and the functions quadruple and
double that we defined

48
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,030
in the test.hs will be
available. For example, we can call

49
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,500
quadruple of 10

50
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,819
and it will return 40, but we can also

51
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:21,049
still call all the standard library
functions. For example

52
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:24,660
we can take

53
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:30,070
double of 2 of this list. Double of 2 is
4, so this is the same as take 4,

54
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,650


55
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,820
so we take the first 4 elements
of the list.

56
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:39,200
Now what we do

57
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,540
is we just leave GHC open, we
returnw to our editor and

58
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,579
add

59
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:51,290
2 new definitions: one is factorial

60
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:56,750
and the other one is average. 
Since we're starting here,

61
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,180
we are using some syntax that 
we haven't introduced yet so

62
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,380
bear with me. 
So product

63
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,100
of 1 to n - this thing here 

64
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,840
is the list of values 1 up to n -

65
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,070
and then product is the
standard library function

66
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,169
that multiplies all the values 
in a list, so

67
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:24,330
this is a good definition of factorial.
Then when we want to calculate the

68
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,480
average

69
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,350
of a list we sum

70
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,780
all the elements - the values of the elements -
and we divide that

71
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,020
by the length of the list. 
Of course, this is not a very smart

72
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,780
implementation of average, but that
doesn't matter... we're not

73
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,750
here to define average, we're doing
this to learn

74
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:51,220
GHCi. The thing that we're using here is
this trick here in Haskell

75
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,280
is that when you put a function name

76
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,390
between these single back quotes,

77
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,580
it becomes an infix operator.

78
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,290
So if you write

79
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,620
x `f` y

80
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,900
that's really just syntactic sugar for

81
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,410
f x y. Some people like this thing
as an infix operator,

82
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,640
others like it just as a regular
operator

83
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,690
- it's your choice. 
This is syntactic convention. So this is not

84
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,960
a string or anything,

85
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,440
it's really taking a function and turning
that into an infix operator.

86
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,290
Then in GHCi, we call reload

87
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:39,020
and it will read the file

88
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,920
test.hs, add all the new bindings that we just
defined

89
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,410
- that was for factorial, so we can now
call factorial

90
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,610
and then we can call average as well.

91
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:54,520
Here you see the workflow:
you have your GHCi open, your editor

92
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,360
you edit, you call reload, and then you
can try

93
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,430
your code out. 
A few syntactic

94
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,960
things, or oddities in Haskell:
functions

95
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,480
and parameter names must begin with
lower case

96
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,730
letters.

97
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:19,530
If you define a function, it must be

98
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,010
of any of these forms. 
But any of these

99
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,720
starts with a lower case

100
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,580
letter. You can use a regular quotes

101
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,310
if you're too lazy to
invent a name. That's

102
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,950
something that I often miss in other
languages, where I just want to say

103
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,710
x prime or

104
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,520
x double prime, et cetera.

105
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,210
If you define a type, a type
has to start with an

106
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,710
uppercase name and that's the
reason. In Haskell,

107
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,130
the types and identifiers

108
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,180
are in different namespaces and that's
determined

109
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,620
by whether it starts with a lower case or

110
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,540
upper case identifier. That can be
confusing if you come from a different

111
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,830
language like

112
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,990
Java, or C# or JavaScript.

113
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,000
The other thing is that in
Haskell we use

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,800
a very mild form of Hungarian
notation.

115
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,930
If a parameter has an

116
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:27,700
s suffix, so for example if you have a
parameter named

117
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,420
xs or ns or nss,

118
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,840
that means a list of values

119
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,640
of type x and this is a list of
values

120
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,460
of type n - sometimes the n doesn't
correspond to the

121
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,360
type name - but typically when you see an
s at the end you know that it's a list.

122
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,460
If there's 2 s's at the end 
- like here -

123
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,910
you know that it's a list of lists.

124
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,630
Thats by convention. So if you want to
look like a real Haskell programmer,

125
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:03,370
you should always use this convention.
When your parameter is a list, 

126
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,250
it always ends with s, and usually

127
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,410
Haskell identifiers are short

128
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,900
so you don't it elements,
you call it xs.

129
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,510
Another

130
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,370
interesting thing that Haskell has in
common with by Python

131
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,050
is that white space is significant. 
The

132
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,100
exact rules are quite subtle, but

133
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,350
we are just using Haskell

134
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,630
in very simple ways, so this

135
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,880
is kind of sufficient. If you have a
sequence of definitions - like here -

136
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,600
they all have to start in the same
column. Here

137
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,760
a, b and c all start

138
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,230
in the same column.
In this case here,

139
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,300
b has a space to the left of it,

140
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,780
so now all these definitions don't start
in the same column.

141
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,860
That's wrong! 
Or in this case, c

142
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,990
and a don't start in the same column as b..

143
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,130
also wrong.

144
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,460
White space is significant in Haskell,

145
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,600
so make sure that all your definitions
are lined up - this is called the layout rule.

146
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,290
The layout rule

147
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,660
is there to avoid writing

148
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,080
unnecessary syntax. 
Haskell folks

149
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,050
like to write this: 
a = b + c where

150
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,510
and then in the where clause we have
a list of definitions that

151
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,230
all start in the same column and then d

152
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,440
here stars in the same column as a,

153
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,060
so that belongs to the same group
as a.

154
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,950
You can write this with explicit

155
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,920
curly braces and semicolons
- if you want to -

156
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,700
but that looks a lot more

157
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,850
verbose. 
Haskell programmers like brevity,

158
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,110
so they'll often use significant white
space.

159
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,640
This looks a little bit clowny.

160
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,520
In the Haskell world, when you write code like
this people will look like

161
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,090
"you didn't do enough wax on, wax off".

162
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:21,090
Here's some GHC commands that are
useful

163
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,330
and I really

164
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:29,620
invite you to play around with it
When you do the exercises for

165
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,220
subsequent lectures, make sure that you
leverage

166
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,800
GHC or whatever other compiler you use,

167
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,930
to help you. We have seen
reload, but you can also just

168
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:45,820
load a fresh script.

169
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,050
From the interpreter

170
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,430
you can open the editor, so you can edit

171
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:56,270
a file with a certain name, 
or edit the current script.

172
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,880
This one here is super useful:

173
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,550
it gives the type of an expression and I do
this

174
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:08,330
all the time - I never write types myself. 
I ask what the type is and I go

175
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,589
in the editor and paste in the type.

176
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:15,959
You definitely should use :?

177
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,649
and that gives you a list of all the
commands

178
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:23,970
with a small explanation. 
Of course,

179
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,350
I hope that you will not use this

180
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,079
last command to quit GHC,

181
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:34,450
but that you will, for the next
eight weeks,

182
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:39,709
be constantly using GHC.

183
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:43,010
There will be a lot of exercises

184
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,660
and the exercises will be on the website.

185
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,680
All these exercises,

186
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,510
you should be able to
do them in any language. You don't

187
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,600
have to use

188
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,990
GHC, but in this case, since this lecture
is about

189
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,029
GHC, they will be

190
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:06,610
GHC-specific. 
In general,

191
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,680
as I said in the very first lecture, this
is a course

192
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,430
about functional programming. It's not a
course about Haskell and it's definitely

193
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,320
not a course about GHC,

194
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,020
but in this specific case the exercises for
this chapter and

195
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,250
for this lecture are on GHCi.

196
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,459
Happy hacking and 
see you all next week!
